# Medical Appointment No-show Analysis
## By Murong (Sophie) Cui

## Introduction

> This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

## Data Cleaning
1. convert the data type
> After investing the data type for each columns, I convert the columns 'ScheduledDay' and 'AppointmentDay' to datetime data type.
2. assign new columns
> I assign a new column 'Duration', which represents the day difference between the appointment day and the day scheduled the appointment.<br>
It seems like there are some appointment that is scheduled at the same day, we can prevent that value by setting the same day scheduled to 0. <br>
And also assigning the column 'DayofWeek' to show which day of week for the appointment day.
3. rename the columns
> There are some column name in Spanish, convert them to English.
4. check erroneous data/ missing data
> Age: There is on missing values in the dataset. And one record has negative age. Therefore I drop the error record. And these are 7 patients are more than 100 years old, which considered as outliers. I drop these appointments as well. <br>
> For Handicap: in the data description, it is said that the handicap attribute should be boolean. However, the handicap assumes values from 0 to 4. I map 0 to 0 and else to 1
5. Convert the dummy variable to numeric variable

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Research Question:
What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?

1. Overall, we could see that out of 106987 reservations around 21680 of them have turned no show and that's around 20%

2. Gender:
   - Below we can see out of the 106987 appointments, there are 70118 female patients and 36869 male patients.
   - The ratio of Females to Males that have turned up looks similar to those who have not come for the visit.
   - So gender may not play an important role in determining if a patient comes for a visit or not.

3. Age:
   - Age seems to influence negatively to no show rate at the age of 10 - 70 years. From age of 70 to age of 100, age shows positively influences to no show rate.
   - The age of 110-120 has highest no show rate, regrading the number of patients in this age range is small (7), it is reasonable to consider this age interval as outlier.

4. Condition: (Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handicap, Hypertension, Scholarship, SMS_received)
   - Having Diabetes, Handicap and Hypertension slightly decrease the no show rate.
   - Alcoholism has no influence to no show rate
   - Enrolling the scholarship increases the no show rate.
   - SMS_received: there are 72402 appiontments not received SMS and ouot of them around 16.7% are no show. Out of 34585 appointments which have received SMS around 27.66% of them did not show up. As we can see a clear distinction between people receiving SMS that was received and not receiving SMS, this feature will help us in determining of a patient will turn up for the visit after taking an appointment.

5. Duration: the numbers of days between the scheduling  date and appointment date
   - When the duration is longer than 100 days, the no show rate dramatically increases.

6. Neighborhood:
   - As most of neighborhoods have aroud 80% show rate. However, the neighborhood of ILHAS OCEÃ‚NICAS DE TRINDADE has 100% no show rate, and the neighborhood of PARQUE INDUSTRIAL has 0% no show rate, and these two neighborhood carries the lowest number of appointment.
